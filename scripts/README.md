## How to use this shcript?

This thing will automatically get the latest stable version of `OpenWRT` 
and prepare the build env for cross-compiling (hopefully) Rust libraries into .ipk packages for Nym. 

Right now it should only do the gateway for the sake of simplicity but the build may fail at this point. 

It will nevertheless, compile the whole OpenWRT without needing to manually do anything within the GUI image builder.
